A quick calculator for trading types of currency in the game Team Fortress 2

A niche project I decided to make because when trading these 2 different kinds of currencies in the game, I would often face the issue of having to do the calculations in my head, or even write them down and use a normal calculator, which would take around 1-3 minutes depending on the amount of cuurency being traded. The one currency splits into 3 seperate currencies, so it's not a quick and simple calculation, so I made this program to quickly do the calculations for you, saving time and effort.
